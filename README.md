# LOTR Adapter Plugin
## How to use it:
As with all minecraft mods, download the jar and drop it in your mods folder.

## Expected uses:
This mod is expected to be a vanilla server plugin... it was not designed with spigot/bukkit 
or any other server plugins you have. . . it is just a mod that happens to be serverside only.

## How it works:
This mod adds in 4 recipes:
1. 1 bronze + 1 glowstone dust = 2 redstone dust. 
2. Unbreaking 3 and Fortune 3 encanted books may be crafted with 3 enduring scrolls, and 3 blessed scrolls respectively.
3. Protection, Proj Prot., Fire Prot. and Feather falling 4 may be crafted with 4 of the corresponding max tier scrolls.
4. Efficiency 5 may be crafted with 5 masterful books.

## What's with the seeds?
Because of limitations both with crafting recipes and this mod being serverside, 
the technical result of the crafting recipes is a wheat seed.
If the scrolls inside do not align with one of the above recipes, the scrolls are dropped on the ground upon craft
to avoid being consumed.
If the scrolls do match one of the recipes, the enchanted book is placed in the players inventory.

If there was any other way to do this, I would have.
